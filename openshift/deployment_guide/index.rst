When you complete this guide, you should have a functioning deployment of the
SDP. This includes a Jenkins master, one or more Jenkins agents, and services
used by SDP libraries, such as SonarQube.

This guide also covers setting up a space in OpenShift
that can be automatically deployed to using the "OpenShift" SDP Library. This
includes a Tiller server for deployments via Helm, as well as separate
application environments such as "Dev" and "Test"
