Section 3.1 - Creating the Application Environments
===================================================

========
Overview
========

In order to use the |openshift_library|'s |deploy_step|, there needs to be
set of pre-configured projects in OpenShift:

* The application environments, one or more Openshift projects that will host the application (e.g. "my-app-dev" & "my-app-prod")
* A project to host container images that are shared between the application environments
* A project to host the |tiller_server| that manages the application environments.

You can create all of these using the |provision_app_envs_script|.

=============
Prerequisites
=============

In addition to the prerequisites covered in the |section_overview|, make sure

1) You are logged into the OpenShift cluster you're deploying to as a user with the |cluster-admin_role|
2) None of the projects that the provision app envs script will create already exist (not likely if this is your first run)

=============================
Getting provision_app_envs.sh
=============================

Clone the |sdp-helm-chart_repository| if you haven't already, and use your
terminal to navigate to the ``resources/helm`` folder. You should see a file called
``provision_app_envs.sh``. You can execute it with the ``-h`` flag to view the
options for running it.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ git clone https://github.com/boozallen/sdp-helm-chart.git

  script usage:
  -p | set's the tenant prefix.
  -e | define an app env. can be used multiple times.
  -i | defines the project images will be pushed to.

  example:
    ./provision_app_envs.sh -p rhs -e dev -e test -e staging -e prod -i red-hat-summit

  this example would create the following projects:
   1) rhs-tiller     | tiller server for this tenant
   2) red-hat-summit | project for storing pushed images
   3) rhs-dev        | dev app environment
   4) rhs-test       | test app environment
   5) rhs-staging    | staging app environment
   6) rhs-prod       | prod app environment
  where:
   1) rhs-{dev,test,staging} can pull images from red-hat-summit
   2) rhs-tiller can deploy resources to rhs-{dev,test,staging}

=================================
The Options You Need to Decide On
=================================

You need a prefix for the application environment names. It's an arbitrary
name that makes it possible to distinguish your application from others that may
share the same cluster. This prefix is ideally an abbreviation of your project
name. In the example above, the prefix for the "RedHat Summit" project is "rhs."

You need to know how many environments you want, as well as abbreviated names for
each. These abbreviated names are placed after ``-e`` in the script's options.
In the example above, there are four environments being provisioned: dev, test,
staging, and prod. The script will create an OpenShift project for each one:
rhs-dev, rhs-test, rhs-staging, and rhs-prod.

.. note::

  These abbreviated names map to the "short names" of the |application_environments|
  in your pipeline configuration file(s).

You also need a name for the project hosting the container images. This is the
*full name of the project* and will not necessarily include the prefix (unlike
the other projects being created). In the example above, that project is called
"red-hat-summit".

==================
Running The Script
==================

Putting it all together, execute the provision_app_envs script, using the
appropriate flags to provide the three pieces of information covered above.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ bash provision_app_envs.sh -p $PREFIX -e $ENV_1 -e $ENV_2 ... -e $ENV_N -i $IMAGE_PROJ

The script should take care of the rest, creating and setting up projects for
the application environments, images, and tiller server. For example, if
you ran this command, with the prefix "demo", a dev and prod environment, and
an image project called "demo", you should see the projects below created:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ bash provision_app_envs.sh -p demo -e dev -e prod -i demo

.. csv-table:: Provisioned OpenShift Infrastructure
   :header: "Project", "Description"

   "demo-dev", "The Development application environment"
   "demo-prod", "The Production application environment"
   "demo-tiller", "The tiller project"
   "demo", "The project where we will configure SDP to push container images"

=======================================
Adding The Tiller Credential To Jenkins
=======================================

.. TODO: automate this away...

The tiller server just created cannot be used without credentials, so those
credentials need to be added to Jenkins. Assuming your tiller project is called "demo-tiller", follow
:ref:`this guide<add credentials to jenkins>` to create a username/password
credential in Jenkins with the username ``system:serviceaccount:demo-tiller:tiller``
and use the command below to get the password, which will output a token you
need to copy-paste into Jenkins. For easy identification, make the credential's
ID the same as the name of the tiller project (i.e. *demo-tiller*).

.. code-block:: bash

  $ oc sa get-token tiller -n demo-tiller
