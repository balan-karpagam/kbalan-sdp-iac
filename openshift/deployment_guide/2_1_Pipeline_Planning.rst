Section 2.1 - Pipeline Planning
===============================

=========================
Identify Your Source Code
=========================

Where are you, or your team's developers, storing their code? Ideally, there's
some source code management tool (SCM) that's being used to centralize, share, and
manage source code. The SDP takes advantage of these features of SCMs in your
CI/CD pipelines.

Currently, the preferred SCM is |GitHub|, which is where the SDP keeps and maintains its
source code. Other Git-based SCMS like GitLab are also viable, as are other SCMs
like Mercurial, though the SDP libraries to support them have not yet been created.

=========================
Understand Your Pipeline
=========================

A basic DevSecOps, CI/CD Pipeline will do three things: build, deploy, and test.
It should take the raw source code and change it to a format that will run
optimally on your platform. It should also take the output of the build and
deploy it to your platform. Lastly it should be automatically testing various
aspects of the application and all throughout the pipeline - anything from unit
tests to penetration tests.

There are myriad ways to do any of these three tasks, but because it's assumed you'll
be deploying on OpenShift we can make some assumptions about your pipeline.

--------
Building
--------

Since OpenShift is a container application platform, and it's assumed that your
application is being deployed to OpenShift, it can also be assumed that your application
running as (Docker) containers. The SDP's |docker_library| makes it easy to
build images from your source code repository and store them in OpenShift's
built-in container registry.

.. important::

   OpenShift has some |guidelines_around_container_images| that it's important
   to be aware of. The section on supporting arbitrary user IDs is especially
   important.

-------
Testing
-------

The SDP currently has libraries for tools that run |code_quality_tests|,
|accessibility_compliance_tests|, |penetration_tests| and more. Which ones you should
use depends on the needs of your application. Automated tests like these are useful for
detecting issues earlier in a feature's lifecycle, where it's easier (and
cheaper) to correct.

---------
Deploying
---------

The |openshift_library| makes it easy to deploy to different OpenShift projects
using |Helm|, a Kubernetes/OpenShift package manager and templating tool. How to
deploy an application is defined in a Helm chart or charts, which is maintained
in your SCM alongside your source code and pipeline configuration. This is covered
in greater detail in Section 3.
